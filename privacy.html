        <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
        <p><strong>1.0 Information We Collect</strong><br>we do not collect any information related to you.</p>
        <p><strong>1.2 Information you provide to us</strong><br>All the data you provide stays on the device, except when you explicitly choose to use the scanning features described below.</p>
        <p><strong>2.0 What Personal Information we collect about you and how we collect it</strong><br>We do not collect any personal information. When you use optional scanning features, documents may be transmitted directly from your device to a third‑party processor as described below; these transmissions are not stored by us.</p>

        <h2>AI Processing and Third‑Party Servers</h2>
        <p>To enable document scanning (for example, bank statements and receipts), the App may upload the documents you select to Google‑operated servers for AI/ML processing. The documents are sent solely for automated extraction/classification and are handled under Google’s terms and policies.</p>
        <p>We do not keep copies of these documents on our servers, and we do not build profiles from them. Processing occurs between your device and Google’s systems. Please make your choices accordingly; if you are not comfortable with this transmission and processing, do not use the scanning features.</p>
        <p><strong>3.0 How we keep and secure the Personal Information we collect</strong><br>All the data provided by you stays on the device. Documents you submit for scanning are transmitted to Google for processing and are not kept by us. If you wish to delete your local data, simply delete the app from your device; we do not store copies on our servers.</p>
